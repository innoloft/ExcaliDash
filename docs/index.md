## Your drawings, on your server

ExcaliDash is an open-source workspace built around the Excalidraw editor. Keep your drawings in a persistent database, organize them into collections, and work together in real time. It is an independent project, not an official Excalidraw product.

### Self-host Excalidraw with Docker Compose

Run the frontend and backend on your own machine, homelab, or server. The default stack uses SQLite and a persistent Docker volume. Follow the [Excalidraw self-hosting guide](/deploy/docker) for installation, HTTPS, and upgrades.

### Draw together and control access

Invite people to drawings or collections, choose viewing or editing permissions, and collaborate with live cursors. Use local accounts or OpenID Connect for sign-in. Read the [collaboration guide](/guide/collaboration) and [authentication setup](/guide/authentication).

### Save, restore, and back up

Drawings are stored on your server so you can return to them from another device. Browse version history, restore an earlier drawing, and export your library. Learn [how storage and backups work](/guide/storage-backups).

## Questions about self-hosting Excalidraw

### What does ExcaliDash add to Excalidraw?

ExcaliDash embeds the Excalidraw editor and adds a dashboard, persistent drawing storage, collections, sharing permissions, collaboration, version history, and account management.

### Can I collaborate on my own server?

Yes. The ExcaliDash backend handles real-time collaboration. Your reverse proxy must forward WebSocket connections; the [Docker guide](/deploy/docker#configure-https) explains the setup.

### Does restarting Docker erase my drawings?

The default Compose stack stores data in the `backend-data` volume, which survives container restarts and ordinary `docker compose down`. Deleting the volume removes that data. Keep [separate backups](/guide/storage-backups).

### Can I use my existing Excalidraw files?

Yes. ExcaliDash supports import and export of drawings in `.excalidraw` format, as well as library export and import for moving your workspace.
