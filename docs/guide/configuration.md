# Configuration

Configure ExcaliDash with environment variables.

## Local development

Copy the example files before starting the services:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
```

Keep secrets in untracked `.env` files.

In `backend/.env`, replace the generated `<backend>` path placeholders:

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL=file:./dev.db
BACKUP_DIR=./backups
```

## Docker Compose

Compose reads substitutions from your shell or a root `.env` file:

```dotenv
EXCALIDASH_TAG=latest
AUTH_MODE=local
FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MB=100
```

For example, create `compose.override.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    environment:
      SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS: "7"
```

Start the services:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f compose.override.yml up -d
```

## Workspace preferences

For appearance and editor preferences, open the account menu and select **Settings**. The controls below change workspace preferences; server environment variables are configured in the files above.

## Signing secrets

The Docker entrypoint generates and persists signing secrets if you leave them unset. To manage them yourself, generate two different values:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Set `JWT_SECRET` and `CSRF_SECRET` in the root `.env`. Keep them stable across restarts and out of Git. Note that `JWT_SECRET` must contain at least 32 characters in production.

See the [environment reference](/reference/environment).
