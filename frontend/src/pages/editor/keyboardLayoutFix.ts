/**
 * Excalidraw matches single-key shortcuts against `event.key` — the character
 * the layout produces, not the physical key (`findShapeByKey`). Under a
 * non-Latin layout that character never matches: on a Russian keyboard the
 * physical R key reports "к", so R/T/V/O and the rest of the toolbar stop
 * working. Upstream falls back to `event.code` for undo/redo only
 * (excalidraw PR #5944), which leaves the tools broken.
 *
 * Fix: in the capture phase — ahead of Excalidraw's own listener on
 * `.excalidraw-container` and of this app's window listeners — rewrite a
 * non-Latin `event.key` to the Latin letter that sits on the same physical
 * key, read from `event.code`. Going through `code` instead of a layout table
 * covers every non-Latin layout, not just Cyrillic.
 *
 * Typing is untouched: text fields (including Excalidraw's hidden textarea for
 * on-canvas labels) and IME composition are skipped, so Cyrillic text still
 * types as Cyrillic. Returns a cleanup that detaches the listener.
